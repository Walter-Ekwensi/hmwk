            <p>THE INTRODUCTION</p>
            <p>Players are sent on an adventure quest to gather scattered jigsaw puzzle pieces in this immersive and engrossing gaming experience. In this game, players go through a carefully constructed virtual world that is filled with challenging quests. The goal of the game is to explore the deliberately planned map, which is meant to evoke a sensation of discovery. Players must find the missing jigsaw puzzle pieces hidden all around the surroundings as they travel through intriguing locations. Each puzzle piece acts as an essential component that needs to be put together to reveal its hidden image. As the main character in this immersive adventure, players will encounter a variety of challenges and work through challenging puzzles that will put their problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and perseverance to the test. The game emphasizes the value of perseverance and the benefits it delivers by encouraging players to think critically, examine their environment, and make strategic decisions to overcome obstacles. Beyond the captivating gameplay, this game imparts practical knowledge, developing abilities that go beyond the virtual world. As they look for the elusive puzzle pieces, players will hone their attention to detail and develop acute observational skills. They will work on their cognitive abilities, hone their capacity for pattern detection, and improve their spatial awareness. Additionally, if I choose to put up the enormous amount of effort and make this game multiplayer, it will encourage cooperation and communication, allowing players to set off on this stimulating trip with one another. Participants can combine their distinct viewpoints, share insights, and plan ahead to discover and put together the puzzle pieces effectively by working in groups with friends. This game strives to capture and inspire players of all ages and imparts useful skills that go well beyond the game's virtual environment by fusing engaging gameplay, exciting challenges, and important real-life skills.

            <p>THE PROBLEM</p>
            <p>The goal of the game is to address the issue of inadequate cognitive development in both children and adults. Inadequate cognitive development can have a significant impact in adults and children as it affects problem solving skills, decision making capabilities and overall intellectual functioning. Cognitive development refers to the growth and/or increase of cognitive processes, including perception, attention span, memory, reasoning and problem solving. Players are challenged to use their problem-solving, critical thinking, and attention to detail skills in the game—all of which are crucial for the development of the brain. The majority of people in today's world are incapable of thinking beyond what their mind deems logical or comfortable, and as social media takes over more and more of people's lives, they become trapped in one mindset and lose their fluidity, which causes their brain to impose several limitations on itself because it isn't being used for anything productive. So, this game intends to teach the necessary lessons that will make people better at thinking, lessons such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving</p>
                    <p>As they look for puzzle pieces and determine how they fit together to finish the puzzle, players may practice problem-solving and critical thinking abilities while playing the game. This translates into situations in daily life where problem-solving skills are needed, such as making decisions, assessing challenging situations, and coming up with original solutions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Patience and perseverance</p>
                    <p>Players may need to conduct extended searches or overcome obstacles in order to uncover every piece of the puzzle, which can make collecting them challenging and time-consuming. This can impart valuable traits that can be applied to real-life obstacles, such as the importance of perseverance and the benefits of continuing with a task.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Attention to Detail and Observation</p>
                    <p>Players must pay great attention to details and carefully scan their surroundings in order to find all the puzzle parts. In many real-world scenarios, such as problem identification, research, and attention to crucial details, this can improve players' capacity for observation, the ability to spot patterns, and attention to detail.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spatial Awareness and Coordination</p>
                    <p>Spatial awareness is basically a person’s ability to understand and be conscious of the space or environment around them and the objects in that environment in relation to said person’s position in that space. Players' spatial awareness and coordination improve as they navigate puzzle pieces and explore the game's map. This can be used in everyday activities like organizing areas or effectively packing items as well as occupations that call for spatial thinking, such as engineering and architectural design.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Focus and Concentration</p>
                    <p>
                        Finding puzzle pieces in the game encourages focus and concentration because players must remain engaged and vigilant to find the pieces. People who want to succeed in academic or professional environments where it's important to maintain focus and disregard distractions should develop these skills.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pattern Recognition and Cognitive Abilities</p>
                    <p>Players' capacity for pattern identification and cognitive abilities can be improved by seeing patterns among puzzle components or inside the game itself. This may have applications in disciplines like arithmetic, data analysis, problem-solving, and decision-making, where the ability to spot patterns is frequently crucial.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Collaboration and Communication(maybe)</p>
                    <p>If I someday decide to go through the effort of adding multiplayer, it can foster good teamwork and communication skills. To locate and put together the puzzle pieces, players may need to coordinate their efforts, communicate information, and plan together. This fosters abilities that are beneficial in group projects or team-based job contexts.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The game's overall goal is to address the issue of cognitive under-stimulation and to encourage brain development in a fun and enjoyable way. It gives people the chance to partake in mentally challenging activities, practice their problem-solving skills, and gain a sense of cognitive growth and development. The game can provide players with useful skills and insights that can be applied to different facets of their lives by including these real-world teachings and problem-solving features into the gameplay.</p>

            <p>MY SOLUTION(basically a devlog)</p>
            <p>When first developing this project, I decided I would use unity since unreal engine seemed more complicated (I was wrong, its the other way around). I made a project and started out with an empty world. So, the first thing I did was build the worlds outline. I did this using a tool called Probuilder, which is one of unity’s packages that make creating and designing levels a lot easier. The next thing I did was to make a playable character this bit took quite a while. Then I made a movement script. For the players body I used a capsule which is easy and simple since the game will be using a first person perspective. After that point I then added the camera and made a script attached to it that allow the player to look around with the mouse like a first person game. After the player was finally done and working in the way I wanted it to, I started on deciding how I want m games levels to look. I wanted to make a game with the aim being to solve a puzzle and collect pieces, but I did not consider how hard it would be to come up with a puzzle to solve. So, I just kept adding more things to the world. First, I added some walls because compared to the player the area was too big. I also added a door which helped me later on to think of how I want this to look. Then I had to make the jigsaw puzzle pieces while I thought of what else to add to the world. So for this I had to learn how to use blender. the actual process of making the pieces was surprisingly easy with the help of some tutorials. What I did was use this website called https://draradech.github.io/jigsaw/jigsaw.html  to make the layout of the puzzle. The layout that I made on this website was then imported into blender and used as a template for the pieces. I used the skills that id learn to make a plane shape the use the layout as a guide to cut out the puzzle piece from the shape in blender. Then when I was done with that I imported it into unity as one of my assets. At this point I had thought of the kind of game I wanted my game to be. I didn’t want an ordinary puzzle game I wanted to make something non-Euclidean in some form or another as, after some research it seems those types of games have the most interesting and compelling puzzles. At this point have also built up more of the map and decided the whole thing would just be a single level. Then I needed a way for the player to interact with the puzzle pieces. I had only a few options of an inventory system where one you touch the piece it despawns and then is now present in your inventory or a way to pick up and place the puzzle pieces. I like the latter more because it seems more interactive and later becomes more central in the playstyle of the game. So I found some tutorial for how to make things like a gravity gun which is an item featured in a game called Portal which is one the big inspiration for my game. After several tutorials I ended up with something very similar and it works exactly as intended. The laser allow for the player to pick up and orient the puzzle pieces however the wish to do so. It works on objets with a rigidoby component which means it can only be used on objects that can be affectted by gravity. Next I separated the puzzle pieces around the map and now had to think of the gimmick that this level would use. The world was still looking to empty so I added floors and stairs to fill it up some more. This was a good choice as it allowed me to finally think of an idea for the level: teleportation. the idea was to have teleportion be the main  element of this level however the twist was that the teleporters would be invisible but the eviroment is setup in a way that you would be able to figure out where they are. in this case the teleporters are these green boxes which are actually invisible in the game. The teleporters are connected like this: 1 to2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7, 7 to 8 and 8 to 9 but 9 is actual the cube which I may or may not have mentioned earlier. I did this because I see it as a good idea to have a moveable destination point. Then I had to add forward projection which is how far the player is launched forawrd after they are teleported. I had to add this feature because beforehand I was having this issue where because all the destinations apart from 9 are also teleporters themselves, the player would get stuck in a teleportation loop. Then I added more rooms at the top floors where if go into the room you will be teleported to the cube(9). No matter which one of them you enter, you are sent straight to 9. I want this to be the main way players are expected to complete the level as the other telepoters have far too much going on for the players to complete the level in any reasonable amount of time. Ive also decided that the players will have to get all the pieces from the four corners of the world and and assemble them in the middle where they begin. Then I wrote a script which basically makes it so when ever I press “E” I get teleported to the cube straight away ignoring the part where I have to keep going up the stairs. The players arent expected to use this but perhaps it can be unlocked as a reward for completeing the level normally first. Finally I needed a way for the level to conclude. So once the player collects all the pieces and bring them to the center, I want an animation to play of the pieces connecting and enlarging to display an image however I don’t have an image on my puzzle it is very very easy to add if need be. There is a time limit on how long you get to complete the level althought I had a very unique idea on how the timer would work. Instead of using a conventional timer I decided to use the cube instead. As I said earlier the intended way to beat the level is using the cube to bypass the telepoters as the cube is not affected by them, then go up the stairs and find one of the cube teleporters, teleport to the cube, get the piece and throw it to safety so you can get the cube and go find another piece. The cube is crucial for beating the level so I decided to use the cube as a timer. As time passes the cube will conitually get bigger till its too big to move through doors, then it becomes too big to teleport to which at that point you have basically lost although it is still possible to win just much harder but also depending on where you leave the cube it can also block of a whole section making it impossible to get any piece left there. This is how the timer works. From between 0sec to 600sec the scale(size) will be increased 50x so if the initial size was 2 after the 10 minuites it will be 100. In the end, everything works as intended. All bugs have been dealt with. I believe that the game Ive created does a good job at visualizing the initial idea I had for adressing the lack of cognitive abilities within people of today. In fact there are some people who have tried the game and are already complaining about difficulty without taking a single second to actually try and figure it out. This is evidence that the game adresses the issuse and helps solve the problem.</p>
